# skeleton-escape

This is a small game built with phaser 3 that follows a skeleton trying to escape the castle before the heros come to destroy him.

## Getting Started

Because this project uses git submodules downloading as a zip file will not allow you to download the submodules(you will have to do this on your own). So you should clone it.

### Prerequisites

node 
	-http-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

### Installing

after cloning you will need to run two commands to get the submodules installed 
	- git submodule init
	- git submodule update
If you download the zip you will need to add the phaser-animated-tiles yourself to the plugins folder

## Built With

* [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) - The game engine used
* [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) - Map editor
* [Animated Tiles](https://github.com/nkholski/phaser-animated-tiles) - Submodule used to animate tiles built in Tiled
