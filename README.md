# skeleton-escape

This is a small game built with phaser 3 that follows a skeleton trying to escape the castle before the heros come to destroy him.

## Getting Started

	Because this project uses git submodules just downloading the zip file will not allow you to download the submodules.
	So you should clone it.

### Prerequisites

	node 
		-http-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

### Installing

	after cloning you will need to run two commands to get the submodules installed 
	Submodules
		- phaser-animated-tiles
	Runhttps://phaser.io/phaser3
		- git submodule init
		- git submodule update
	If you download the zip you will need to add the phaser-animated-tiles yourself to the plugins folder
